      <p>I did my time and I want out, so effusive
	Fade, it doesn't cut, the soul is not so vibrant
	The reckoning, the sickening
	Packaging Subversion, Pseudo-Sacrosanct Perversion

	Go drill your deserts, go dig you graves
	Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
	Sinking in, getting smaller again
	I'm done, it has begun, I'm not the only one

	And the rain will kill us all
	And throw ourselves against the wall
	But no one else can see
	The preservation of the martyr in me

	Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
	Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial</p>

	<p>There are cracks in the road we laid,
	but where the temple fell, the secrets have gone mad
	This is nothing new, but when we killed it all,
	the hate was all we had

	Who needs another mess'. We could start over
	Just look me in the eyes and say I'm wrong
	Now there's only emptiness... venomous, insipid
	I think we're done, I'm not the only one

	And the rain will kill us all
	And throw ourselves against the wall
	But no one else can see
	The preservation of the martyr in me

	Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial
	Psychosocial, psychosocial, psychosocial</p>

  <p> The limits of the dead!
  The limits of the dead!
  The limits of the dead!
  The limits of the dead</p>
